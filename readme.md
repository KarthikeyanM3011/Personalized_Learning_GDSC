## Welcome
Welcome to the AI-Powered Chatbot and RAG System! This project leverages the capabilities of AI models, including the Mixtral model from Hugging Face, to provide intelligent interaction with uploaded documents, quizzes, and assignment generation based on user inputs.

## Chatbot
The Chatbot feature allows users to ask questions and receive responses generated by an AI model. The chatbot can handle various topics and provide accurate information. It utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Features
- **Real-time conversation**: Engage with the chatbot and receive immediate answers.
- **Contextual understanding**: The chatbot remembers previous interactions to provide contextually relevant responses.

## RAG Chat
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chat feature allows users to upload multiple PDF files, which are then processed to extract content for question answering. This feature combines document retrieval with generative responses for enhanced information delivery.

### Features
- **Multiple file uploads**: Users can upload PDFs, PPTs, and DOCX files for analysis.
- **Contextual responses**: The system uses the content of uploaded documents to answer user questions accurately.

## Quiz Generation
The Quiz Generation feature allows the system to create quizzes based on the contents of uploaded files. Users can specify topics or keywords, and the system will generate relevant questions.

### Features
- **Dynamic quiz creation**: Generate quizzes based on document content and specified topics.
- **Variety of question types**: Support for multiple-choice, true/false, and open-ended questions.

## Assignment Generation
The Assignment Generation feature enables users to create assignments based on specific topics or the content of uploaded files. This is particularly useful for educators looking to create tailored assignments for students.

### Features
